# [Project] Robinhood Chess

## Description

In this project, I'm developing a web-based platform for playing the classic chess game with some twists. Ultimately, I will create a game web server and deploy it so my friends and I can play together.

### Story

This summer (2024), I want to embark on a big project to practice my skills. My friend's little brother invented a new rule for chess and got it licensed. Since I've previously created a Chess application, I thought it would be exciting to develop my own chess.com-like platform.

Instead of reusing the old game logic source code from my previous Chess JavaFX project and using Java Spring (which I've grown tired of) to build the website, I decided to put my Go programming skills to good use by rewriting the entire project and creating a game web server in Go.

That's why I'm writing this blogâ€”to share the process of creating this platform with you.
